**IMPORTANT: This is a proof of concept prototype and shouldn't be used in production**

For fast development of DApps a package management is needed. 
Spore is a Proof of Concept prototype for a such package manager build on top of truffle, ethereum and ipfs.

Any form on Feedback and contribution is highly wellcome.



## Installation
This will guide you trough a **local** development installation. The contract is not deployed on a global chain, yet.

Make sure you have node v4+ installed:
```
$ node --version
v4.0.0
```

Make sure you have [solidity](https://github.com/ethereum/cpp-ethereum/wiki) installed:

```
$ solc --version
solc, the solidity compiler commandline interface
Version: 0.1.1-ed7a8a35/Release-Darwin/clang/JIT
```

Install [eth-testrpc](https://github.com/ConsenSys/eth-testrpc) for testing/ dev purposes.
`pip install eth-testrpc`

Install [truffle](https://github.com/ConsenSys/truffle).
`npm install -g truffle`

Install [ipfs](https://ipfs.io/docs/install/).

clone this repo:
`git clone https://github.com/mhhf/spore.git`

install:
```
cd spore
npm install
npm link
```
Run your rpc client( In this case testrpc `testrpc` )

Deploy the spore ethereum contract with: `npm run truffle`

## Usage
Run your local ipfs node and rpc client in seperate terminals:
```
ipfs daemon
```

```
$ spore --help
Simple package management for Ethereum

Usage:
  spore init
  spore publish 
  spore update
  spore info      <package>
  spore search    <package>
  spore install   <package>
  spore uninstall <package>
  spore add       <path>
  
Arguments:
  <package>                    Package name 
  <path>                       path to file/ directory
  
Options:
  -v, --version                Shows the Version of spore
  -h, --help                   Shows this Help Screen
```

### Workflow
Create a new project:
```
mkdir mypackage 
cd mypackage
truffle init
spore init
```

this will create a spore.json in your root project directory:
```
{
  "name": "mypackage",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "description": "description",
  "dependencies": {},
  "contracts": [],
  "ignore": [],
  "files": []
}
```

install dependencies:
```
spore install LinkedList
spore install mortal
```

add some files:
```
spore add contracts/mycontract.sol
spore add readme.md
```

publish the package:
```
spore publish
```

Now you can install the package `new` along with it's dependencies in another project via:
`spore install new`

## Test
`npm test`
