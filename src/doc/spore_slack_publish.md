@channel:
I'd like to present you my current project "spore" - a decentral package manager for dapp development build on top truffle and ipfs.

Check out the beginners tutorial if you're looking for a quick way in.

* filling spore with content
* integrate a light-wallet into it, so that the user don't need to run a full node to publish packages.
* extend it to other dev-tools and testing-frameworks like populus or embark
* add a ( decentral ) plugin system with pre publish and post publish hooks. Use cases could be:
  * different proposals (pull request) for one package
  * ownership based change voting
  * oracle filter which only allowes a new version, if all tests sucseed
